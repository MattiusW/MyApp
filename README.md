# MyApp
I've working Spring app to portfolio  

This will be a game shop management application where you can create, read, update and delete game. Standard option for Admin. But User can view game, add to cart, delete, view and buy products.  

07.11.2023 - Complete admin view. Can add new game to list and delete with list repository. Repository is still hashmap. I added validation date on user intereface.  
09.11.2023 - I completed a user view template and I added cart. User may add order to cart and remove order on cart.  
If admin remove game on his admin repository this same game is remove on cart and list on user view.
